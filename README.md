**Crowdfunding Blockchain App**

A decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing smart contracts to ensure transparency, trust, and security in the fundraising process.

**Overview**

The Crowdfunding Blockchain App aims to revolutionize the way we raise funds for projects by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. This platform allows project creators to launch campaigns and receive funds in a transparent, secure, and decentralized manner, while providing backers with trust and accountability.

**Features**

1.Decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Ethereum

2.Smart contracts to ensure transparency and security

3.User-friendly interface for project creators and backers

4.Supports ERC-20 compatible tokens for fundraising

5.Milestone-based fund release mechanism

**Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**

1.Node.js (v14.0 or higher)

2.Truffle development framework

3.Ganache or other Ethereum blockchain test environment

4.MetaMask or another web3-enabled browser extension

**Installation**

**Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/Tundekuzco/CrowdfundingBlockchainApp.git

**Change to the project directory:**

cd CrowdfundingBlockchainApp

**Install dependencies:**

npm install

**Deployment**

1.Start your Ethereum test environment (e.g., Ganache).

2.Deploy the smart contracts:

truffle migrate --reset

**3.Run the development server:**

npm run start

4.Open your web3-enabled browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

**Usage**

1.Connect your web3-enabled browser extension (e.g., MetaMask) to the Crowdfunding Blockchain App.

2.Create a new crowdfunding campaign by providing the required information, such as project name, description, funding goal, and deadline.

3.Backers can browse the available campaigns and contribute funds in the form of Ether or ERC-20 compatible tokens.

4.Once the campaign reaches its funding goal, the project creator can request fund release based on pre-defined milestones. The smart contract ensures that funds are released only when the milestones are met.

5.If the campaign does not reach its funding goal within the specified deadline, backers can withdraw their contributions.
